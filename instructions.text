DONE 2. 2+ skills, projects, or work experiences in a list (ordered, description, unordered, up to you!)

DONE3. Add a link to your web app and IoT final project ( just put an empty link for the moment and use a hashtag (#) as a placeholder)

DONE4. A link to your LinkedIn that opens in a new tab (hint: Intro to HTML slides)
    If you don’t have a LinkedIn account yet, that’s fine, just put an empty link for the moment. (use a hashtag (#) as a placeholder)

In addition, include at least the following styling (CSS):
DONE 5. Different font color, font family, and size

DONE 6. 1 imported font, e.g. from Google Fonts (hint: Intro to CSS slides about font-family to see how to import)

DONE 7. A background color on any element

DONE 8. Adjust the size of an img (In the website background)

DONE 9.A use of Bootstrap’s grid layout system

DONE 10.At least two Bootstrap components, such as buttons, navbars, list groups, etc.
